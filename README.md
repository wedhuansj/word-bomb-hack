# Word Bomb Hack - Character Display and Prompt Input Script

This repository contains a Python script that displays characters and includes a prompt input box. The script uses the `tkinter` library for the GUI and `pyautogui` for simulating key presses. It also provides instructions for using the script to exploit the game "Word Bomb" in Roblox and the "Bomb Party" game in jklm.fun.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/wedhuansj/word-bomb-hack.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd word-bomb-and-bomb-party-exploit
    ```
3. **Install the required packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install pyautogui keyboard
    ```

## Usage

1. **Choose Language for Word List:**
    - Navigate to the `worddata` folder.
    - Select your preferred language file and rename it to `wordlist.txt`.
    - Replace the existing `wordlist.txt` in the directory with the chosen file.

2. **Setup:**
    - Arrange the Command Prompt (cmd) and Roblox Player windows side by side on your screen.

3. **Run the script:**
    - Execute `main.py` to start the program:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
    - When it's your turn in the game, enter the prompt into the Command Prompt window and then type the word displayed by the program.
    - To reset the used word list, press Enter with a blank prompt.
    - Close the program to ensure it is fully terminated.
